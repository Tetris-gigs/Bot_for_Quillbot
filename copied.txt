1. **Addiction to Unhealthy Foods**: Processed foods, especially those high in sugar, can trigger dopamine release in your brain, which makes you feel good for a short time, leading to addiction. This causes people to crave and consume more of these unhealthy foods, even when they don't need them.

2. **Lack of Nutritional Value**: Processed and genetically modified foods often contain artificial ingredients, sugars, and high fructose corn syrup that offer little to no nutritional benefit. These foods may lead to gut inflammation, which makes it harder for the body to absorb essential nutrients, causing issues like muscle loss, brain fog, and weight gain.

3. **Immune Response**: Your body treats artificial ingredients (like artificial sweeteners) as foreign invaders, triggering an immune response. This lowers your resistance to diseases since your body is focused on fighting off these foreign substances rather than protecting you from other health risks.

4. **Animal Protein vs. Plant Protein**: Many people prioritize animal protein over plant protein, which leads to a lack of fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients in their diet. This fiber deficiency is linked to serious health conditions, such as colon and breast cancer, Crohn's disease, heart disease, and constipation.
